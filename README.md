## CMS

This project is to create a content management system that offers configurable data structures. These different types of data structures will be known as structures, and individual instances of a structure â€‹will be known as an entry. This content management system will be developed in the form of a Single Page Application that runs multiple web servers and processes. Your product will have a public and private component to it. There will be a part of the CMS that you can view, whether you are logged in or not, to view the content that has been created. Your home page will list each type of structure, as well as how many entries there are for that structure. Your product will also have an administrative component to it. Administrators will be able to define the composition of a structure, as well as create, read, update, or delete entries of each structure. They will also be able to edit users. Admins are users that have some property denoting that they are administrators. Both administrators and non-administrator users will be able to view Structure Entries, as well as post comments on Structure Entries, and favorite Structure Entries. Unauthenticated users will still be able to read all non-admin routes, but will be unable to comment or favorite entries.
